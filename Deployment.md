# Deployment Strategy 

## Where It Fits
The PII Detector & Redactor (`detector_sanidhya_soni.py`) is meant to sanitize logs and API payloads.  
The most effective place to run it is at the **ingress layer**, where external traffic and data first enter the system.

---

## Deployment Options

### 1. API Gateway Plugin (Preferred)
- Integrate the detector at the API Gateway (Kong, NGINX, Envoy).  
- All requests and responses are checked, redacted, then forwarded.  
- **Pros:** Central control, no app code changes, scales easily.  
- **Cons:** Small latency overhead.

### 2. Sidecar Container
- Run the detector as a sidecar in services that generate or forward logs.  
- Logs go through the sidecar before leaving the pod.  
- **Pros:** Works per service, clean separation.  
- **Cons:** Extra containers per pod.

### 3. DaemonSet
- Deploy once per node to scrub logs before theyâ€™re shipped to ELK/Datadog.  
- **Pros:** Centralized logging control.  
- **Cons:** Only covers logs, not API traffic.

## Recommended Approach
Use a **hybrid setup**:
- API Gateway plugin for real-time request/response sanitization.  
- DaemonSet for log pipelines.  

This blocks PII leaks at the edge and ensures stored logs stay clean.

## Performance & Scale
- Regex and masking add only a few ms per record.  
- Containerized version can be scaled horizontally with low overhead.

## Integration Steps
1. Containerize `detector_sanidhya_soni.py`.  
2. Expose a simple REST endpoint (`/sanitize`).  
3. Configure API Gateway to call the service.  
4. Optionally run as a DaemonSet for logs.
